# Syncraft
This is a legal modification of KlipperScreen adapted for Syncraft printers (IDEX).
All rights are reserved to the original creators of the Software, under the AGPL-3.0 use and distribution license.

## Syncraft Compatibility
This software is optimized for Syncraft printers, and it works correctly with a specific set of files and programs.
Attempting to use this software on a different printer may result in unexpected results.

## IDEXScreen (KlipperScreen Fork)
IDEXScreen is a touchscreen GUI that interfaces with [Klipper](https://github.com/kevinOConnor/klipper) via [Moonraker](https://github.com/arksine/moonraker).
It can switch between multiple printers to access them from a single location, and it doesn't even need to run on the same host, you can install it on another device and configure the IP address to access the printer.
